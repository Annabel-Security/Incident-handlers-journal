Incident Handler's Journal

Welcome to my cybersecurity incident journal, created as part of my hands-on learning through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

This space documents real-world scenarios, reflective entries, and analysis of security tools and concepts. Each entry includes a breakdown of key events, the 5 W's, technical observations, and personal takeaways, all with a focus on ransomware, phishing, and incident response.

What You'll Find Here
- Security incident summaries and case studies  
- Reflections on tool usage (e.g., SIEM, antivirus, backups)  
- My growth as an incident handler and cybersecurity analyst  
- Notes and questions sparked by each scenario  
- Journal entries structured for clarity and learning

About Me
I'm currently building my portfolio as a cybersecurity student with a focus on risk assessment, threat modeling, and security awareness. This journal helps me practice documentation, improve analysis, and share insights that connect coursework to real-world impact.

This is a living journal, updated as I continue learning and exploring cybersecurity. Thanks for stopping by
